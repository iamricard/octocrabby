# GitHub block list management

Octocrabby is a small set of command-line tools and extensions to [Octocrab][octocrab]
that are focused on managing block lists on [GitHub][github].

This project [was inspired][1375333996398325762] by an [open letter][rms-support-letter]
supporting Richard Stallman that has been signed by several thousand GitHub users I
don't want to accidentally provide free open source support to.
